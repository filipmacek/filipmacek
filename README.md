### Hi there 👋

## More about me
- 📘 My favorite book is Tao Te Ching. It is such a magnificent piece of poetry about the way things are.
- 🖥️ I love my desk setup - split keyboard (Kinesis Freestyle Pro), flexible standing desk and IDE and VIM for typing
- 🎻 I used to play cello
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I love teaching and sharing knowledge. I used to teach kids mathematics and programming and prepare groups of students for math exams.
- 🎼 I listen mostly ethnotronica, organic, oriental and deep house and a bit of hip-hop/rap. I just like rhythm and sound. But If I want 
something different, jazz and classical music is also my thing.
- 👟 I like sports and movement. My favorite are swimming, skiing, running and climbing
